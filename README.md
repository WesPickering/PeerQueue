# PeerQueue
An office hours queue that allows students to help those in front of them to speed up queue times.

With the growing popularity of introductory Computer Science courses, especially among non-CS majors, 
office hours have become increasingly necessary and critical to student understanding and success. 
From personal experience as CS lab assistants, office hours have become too crowded under the current structure. 
In order to remedy this issue, we developed PeerQueue!

PeerQueue is an online queue system which enables students to get help faster. Students add themselves to a queue 
in order to be helped by a TA. However, we have included the option for queued peers to also seek help from other students. 
This allows students to get more help as well as reduce the number of students in the queue.

This web app was built using Ruby on Rails. Front end was done with HTML and Bootstrap. 
The backend was built with Ruby and deployed to Heroku.
